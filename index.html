        <h1>Enough is Enough</h1>
        <p>Our public district hospital, <strong>Olympic Medical Center (OMC)</strong>, is on the brink of closure and financial insolvency.</p>
        
        <h2>Indisputable Facts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>$72 million dollars “lost” from 2022 to 2025</li>
            <li>5 days cash on hand at the end of 2023 per an official state audit report</li>
            <li>$30 million dollars currently short of meeting bond obligations</li>
            <li>70+ quality citations from the Washington Department of Health</li>
            <li>4 felony convictions against an emergency room physician convicted of sexual assault and rape in 2024</li>
            <li>$1.4 million lawsuit settlement for failing to pay employees in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state requirements in 2024</li>
            <li>142% increase in property taxes passed by voters in 2024 to support OMC</li>
            <li>$30 million dollars of debt resulting in bills and invoices currently going unpaid</li>
            <li>$9 million dollars lost moving forward due to mismanaging of 340B drug discounts</li>
            <li>286 minutes waiting on average for emergency room visit (compared to 161 minutes on average in other WA hospitals)</li>
            <li>6 visits from state auditors since February 2025 for repeated and unaddressed quality and safety problems</li>
            <li>1 immediate jeopardy citation from the Washington Department of Health in April 2025 threatening closure</li>
            <li>3 letters from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid since April 2025 that have threatened to terminate reimbursement</li>
            <li>3 C-suite members that have resigned in disgrace since July 2025</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The question for the publicly elected <strong>Board of Commissioners</strong> is: <span class="highlight">How is this oversight?</span></p>
        
        <p>Yet the publicly elected Board of Commissioners continues to deflect responsibility - hiring an interim CEO at the cost of <strong>$50,000 per month</strong>, spending recklessly and wastefully on additional consultants at the cost of <strong>$250,000 for 6 weeks</strong>, and pointing to a partnership with the University of Washington, which is exploratory, preliminary, and years away from completion (if it even happens) - as “success.”</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the threat of mass layoffs, shuttering of services, and financial collapse continues to loom.</p>

        <p class="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Board of Commissioners has utterly failed in its fiduciary responsibility to provide the necessary oversight of OMC on every level - from ensuring that the public has a safe, quality hospital to providing financial stewardship - leaving the patients, employees, and entire community to suffer the consequences.</p>

        <p class="call-to-action">The citizens of Clallam County deserve better. They deserve accountability. Recall the Board of Commissioners.</p>
